\section{Introduction}
Every user of a supercomputer needs to know whether their submitted job finished successfully and performed well. So far these tedious tasks are usually performed manually using only the output of their program and over-simplified metrics such as job run time and utilizied resources.

The aim of this project is to create a back-propagation neural network which can classify a job run whether it run well or it was in some way suspicious of unwanted behaviour such as poor performance or execution failure.

The network itself is supplied with fine-granular metric data acquired via Examon framework\cite{examon} which was run on Galileo supercomputer located in CINECA, Bologna, Italy. Where all job and metric data were gathered.

The structure of this document is as follows: in section \ref{sec:theory} the theoretical background needed for this project is presented together with the description of Examon framework. In the following section \ref{sec:data} the data supplied to the network are described as well as the final format of the data. Afterwards in section \ref{sec:implementation} the implementation of the network and its structure are laid out and in the last two sections \ref{sec:res} and \ref{sec:sum} the achieved results, summary and further work are discussed.
