\subsection{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:data-filter}
First, job data were queried and filtered according to several rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item job run time must be between 10 and 60 minutes
    \item job must occupy the whole node (multiplies of 16 cores)
    \item job must be run in 15-day period
\end{itemize}
